question: What is the baremetal operator?
---
The bare metal operator is documented at <https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/master/docs/api.md> and it's the operator in charge of definitions of physical hosts, containing information about how to reach the Out of Band management controller, URL of image to provision, plus other properties related with hosts being used for provisioning instances.
